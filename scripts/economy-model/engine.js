// The economy model's engine: one main per account, driven by a seeded queue
// of the named situations, over the game-data snapshot (inputs.js) alone: no
// server module, no World, no database, no clock.
//
// Between two situations a main hunts analytically at its spot: the spot a
// cohort account starts at (Cohort.savedBots: its own, else its travel's, else
// its stay's) while the snapshot has that spot's hour for its line and level
// (spotHours), else its line's best spot for its level. It earns the hour
// (a party member's exp: its party share, huntExp) times the hunting hours
// (wall hours times its stage band's hunting share). Items with a mean count under 5 are drawn whole (Poisson), larger
// counts round by a draw on the fraction, so rare recipes and gear arrive as
// pieces. Situations:
//   level_up      the exp of the next level is reached (from exp per hour);
//                 the kit plan and shot grade follow the new level, and a
//                 main whose spot has no hour at it moves to its line's best.
//   arrived_town  the main is in town: the run's plane runs the visit (today's:
//                 sells its bag, restocks shots, buys the kit pieces its plan
//                 names). When it comes is the plane's nextArrival(main, view)
//                 alone: asked at the start and after
//                 each committed event that changes the main (a visit, a
//                 level-up), its answer is the one pending arrival (replaced,
//                 or dropped by null): today's and the plain mode's plane
//                 answer by the fitted periodic rule.
//                 A bot is in one state at a time: an answer { at, away }
//                 leaves the spot at at - away (the hunt stops there and the
//                 way to town is not hunted), and an arrival it has
//                 left for is held: no later event asks the rule again for
//                 it. A visit's afterHours (its onward stops and its way back
//                 to the spot) are not hunted either.
//   died          a plane with deaths (plane.deaths === true; needs the snapshot's deathExp): the main dies
//                 over its hunting hours at its row's deaths per hour, loses the death exp of its level
//                 (levels down when it crosses the level's start), and the plane's visit runs at once as
//                 in the respawn town, called with died: true; the way back is the visit's afterHours.
//                 It never dies after it has left for town.
//   born          a plane with born: true: each main's one visit at hour 0 (called with born: true), before any
//                 hunting; its way back is the visit's afterHours.
//   situation     a situation the arrival rule names to be read at its hour
//                 without going to town (its answer { at, read: true }, held
//                 in the same pending slot): the main's hunt is committed to
//                 that hour, then the rule is asked again.
//   report        every simulated hour: counters only, never a decision.
// Every mode hunts one way: a main fires the shots its plane names (firing)
// while it holds them, then hunts the hour without shots, at the worn kit's
// kill factor (kills), at the spot its occupation or save chose. The run's
// plane (today.js plane() for today's and the plain mode) owns what differs
// between the modes: its sinks, the visit, the arrival rule, what a main
// fires, its own events and the money it holds apart from the mains.
//
// hunt and visit are pure: they take a main and the view and return the new
// main with the flows it caused; the engine commits both. Rolls are seeded per

//     huntShare the band's share of wall time spent hunting
//   firing(main), kills(main)  the shot a main fires as it hunts and its worn kit's kills (hunt's)
//   hunt(main, delta)  told each committed hunt, the delta with its spotHours and wayHours

//   hour(at)  the money the plane holds apart from the mains at a report hour
//   finish(hours, mains)  { money: { start, end } the plane holds (none: no such money), ...fields the output adds }
